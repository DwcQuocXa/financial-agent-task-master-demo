# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Process Transparency Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Enhance the UI to show the agent's thinking process, including displaying sub-questions being researched.
# Details:
Modify the backend to include intermediate steps (planning and searching) in the streamed response. Update the frontend to parse and display these intermediate steps in the chat interface. Create UI components to visually distinguish between different types of messages (user input, planning steps, search results, final answer). Add animations or visual indicators to show the progression through the agent's thinking process.

# Test Strategy:
Test that intermediate steps are correctly displayed in the UI. Verify the visual distinction between different message types. Get user feedback on the clarity and usefulness of the transparency features.

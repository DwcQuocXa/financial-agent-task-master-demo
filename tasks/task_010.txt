# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Error Handling and Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Add comprehensive error handling, logging, and monitoring to ensure reliability and track API usage.
# Details:
Implement detailed error handling for all API calls and chain steps. Add a logging system to track errors, API usage, and performance metrics. Create a simple dashboard or logging endpoint to monitor API costs and rate limits. Implement graceful fallbacks for when specific tools or models are unavailable. Add user-friendly error messages for different failure scenarios. Consider implementing a simple caching mechanism for repeated queries to reduce API costs.

# Test Strategy:
Test various failure scenarios to ensure proper error handling. Verify logs contain sufficient information for debugging and monitoring. Check that API usage tracking works correctly. Test the caching mechanism if implemented.

# Task ID: 7
# Title: Connect Full Backend Chain
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate all three steps (Plan, Search, Answer) into a complete end-to-end chain in the backend.
# Details:
Create a LangChain sequential chain that connects the planning, searching, and answering steps. Implement proper state management to pass data between steps. Add logging at each step for debugging and monitoring. Implement comprehensive error handling for the entire chain. Connect the complete chain to the /chat endpoint, ensuring the response is properly streamed back to the client.

# Test Strategy:
Test the full chain with various financial questions. Verify each step executes correctly and passes data to the next step. Test error scenarios at each step to ensure graceful degradation. Monitor performance and response times.

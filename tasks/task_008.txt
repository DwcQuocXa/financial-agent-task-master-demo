# Task ID: 8
# Title: Connect Frontend to Backend
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate the React frontend with the Express backend to enable end-to-end functionality.
# Details:
Create an API service in the React app to communicate with the backend. Implement the connection to the /chat endpoint using fetch or axios. Set up handling for the streaming response using EventSource or a similar approach. Update the UI state based on the streaming response. Add loading indicators to show when the agent is thinking/processing. Implement error handling for network issues or backend failures.

# Test Strategy:
Test the complete flow from user input to displayed response. Verify streaming works correctly and updates the UI in real-time. Test network error scenarios and ensure appropriate error messages are displayed to users.
